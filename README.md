Welcome to the 1A2B website! This repository contains some PHP files that you can use to run the game on your computer. I hope you'll enjoy it!  
  
To get started, you'll need to download and install the WAMP server. Once you've done that, create a new folder and move all of the files (except for the SQL file) into it. Then, place the folder in the "C:/wamp64/www" directory on your computer.  
  
Next, you'll need to upload the SQL file to MySQL using phpMyAdmin. The default username is "root" and there is no password.  
  
Finally, start the Wampserver64 application and navigate to "localhost/[folder name]/index.php" in your web browser to start playing the game.  
  
Please note that this repository is for academic exchange only.
